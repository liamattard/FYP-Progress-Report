Several studies both on user profiling and on real-time automatic trip
itinerary generation have been carried out throughout the years. 

\subsection{Automated Trip Systems}

Sylejmani et al.\cite{Sylejmani2017} have defined the Tourist Trip
Design Problem(TTDP) as part of the Orienteering Problem(OP). OP
problems contain a number of nodes each containing a score and try to
solve the path containing the maximal score constrained with
parameters such as time and budget \cite{Gunawan2016}. There are many solutions to this
problem which will be discussed chronologically in the next section.
