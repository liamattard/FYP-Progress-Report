\subsection{Problem Definition}

        Producing an itinerary before a trip can be a demanding task
        which requires  a substantial amount of  research. Many times
        people rely on travel books, individual travel blogs and online
        websites to form a holiday plan, but these are not tailored according 
        to other travellerâ€™s preferences and opinions \cite{DeChoudhury2010}.

        An adequate automated trip planner application would consist
        of two parts, data retrieval based on the end-users and a
        generated itinerary. Numerous systems are available and 
        therefore building a working prototype is both possible and feasible 
        \cite{Sylejmani2017,Sylejmani2012,Sebastia2009a,Tumas2009, 
        Vansteenwegen2011,Kurata2013, RamalhoBrilhante2014, 
        DeChoudhury2010,DUNSTALL2008a, DiBitonto2010a,Gavalas}. 
        Although these systems automate the process of producing the 
        itinerary, they require a lot of end-user data and preferences 
        to form a personalised itinerary. Can the user preference 
        gathering be automated?

        Given the amount of information a single user holds online, 
        it is possible to automate and help the process of 
        gathering personal preferences \cite{Buraya2017}. A deep 
        learning model could be trained to classify a person's social
        media profile to determine what the user wants from a trip. 
        This information alongside other parameters such as the user's
        budget and trip length could give out a very accurate 
        personalised holiday plan.
