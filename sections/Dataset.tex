A dataset of 2747 images was scraped from public Instagram posts from
hashtags by using Puppeteer \footnote{\url{https://pptr.dev/}} (A
javascript web-scraper). The dataset consists of 5 classes, beach,
clubbing, nature, drinks, football with the potential to add more
classes in the future. If a person’s image post falls under a certain
category, more activities leaning towards that activity will be
suggested in the itinerary and therefore a person’s preferences are
collected automatically from Instagram posts and stories. The Beach
dataset contains images of seaside, swimming and summer related
activities, the Nature dataset contains images related to greenery and
landscapes, the clubbing dataset contains crowds and people dancing in
a club, the drinks dataset contains images of cocktails and people in
a bar and the football dataset contains images of stadiums for sport
fans.
