The Proposed solution will consist of three parts:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item A dataset consisting of public Instagram images which will
    be discussed in section cite
    \item A trained Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model to
    predict the image category. A prototype of this model will be
    discussed in section cite.
    \item A method for calculating the scores of activities
    \item A genetic algorithm able to produce itineraries in
    reasonable time and with a high score.
\end{enumerate}
