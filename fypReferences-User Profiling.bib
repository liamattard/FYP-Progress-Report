abstract = {11 MAY2017 Author(s) Anna Terttunen Degree programme Hospitality, tourism and experience management Report/thesis title The influence of Instagram on consumers' travel planning and destination choice Number of pages and appendix pages 55 + 17 Picture is worth a thousand words, as the old saying goes. Photos convey emotions, feelings, thoughts and reality; things that can't be truly described by words. Visual aspects are a big part of travelling and are incorporated in almost all social media platforms, especially the photo sharing application, Instagram. Instagram is one of the biggest and most active social media platforms concentrated on visual communication. The purpose of this thesis was to find out the possible influences of Instagram in travel planning and destination choice, and the potentials of Instagram marketing in travel industry. The aim was also to find out about consumer travel planning behaviour and to come up with suggestions to how destination marketing organizations and tourism marketing managers could develop their marketing strategies. The theoretical framework consists of consumer behaviour, visual communication and Insta-gram in the context of tourism and travelling. The theory is based on literature review and analysing Instagram accounts. The research conducted was based on quantitative methods in form of an online survey. Few open-ended questions were added to the survey in order to get more personal responses. The survey was done with Webropol software and was targeted to young adults living in Fin-land, mainly to those who are active Instagram users. The survey included questions about people's travel habits, travel planning behaviour, Instagram usage and attitudes towards user generated content. The results from the survey were analysed using SPSS statistics and Webropol's own tools for analytics. According to the results, people value visual aspects in travel planning and especially women use Instagram as a source for travel inspiration and information. 82{\%} of the respondents indicated Instagram having had at least some influence in their travel planning. However Insta-gram is not the only source used, as people tend to use various sources to get information when planning their travels. The results revealed some differences within gender and age groups in people's information search behaviour and Instagram usage. The study also found that people trust more on user-generated content than information coming from service providers. Photos shared by real travellers are considered important when planning travels. People are independent in their travel planning and do most of the information search online. Recommendations from family and friends are the most valued and trusted source. The outcome of the research suggests that marketing managers should incorporate user-generated content into their social networking sites and websites, and should be present in Instagram and consider using it as a marketing tool.},

abstract = {This paper proposes demographic estimation algorithms for profiling Twitter users, based on their tweets and community relationships. Many people post their opinions via social media services such as Twitter. This huge volume of opinions, expressed in real time, has great appeal as a novel marketing application. When automatically extracting these opinions, it is desirable to be able to discriminate discrimination based on user demographics, because the ratio of positive and negative opinions differs depending on demographics such as age, gender, and residence area, all of which are essential for market analysis. In this paper, we propose a hybrid text-based and community-based method for the demographic estimation of Twitter users, where these demographics are estimated by tracking the tweet history and clustering of followers/followees. Our experimental results from 100,000 Twitter users show that the proposed hybrid method improves the accuracy of the text-based method. The proposed method is applicable to various user demographics and is suitable even for users who only tweet infrequently.},

abstract = {Automatic image annotation is a difficult and highly relevant machine learning task. Recent advances have significantly improved the state-of-the-art in retrieval accuracy with algorithms based on nearest neighbor classification in carefully learned metric spaces. But this comes at a price of increased computational complexity during training and testing. We propose FastTag, a novel algorithm that achieves comparable results with two simple linear mappings that are co-regularized in a joint convex loss function. The loss function can be efficiently optimized in closed form updates , which allows us to incorporate a large number of image descriptors cheaply. On several standard real-world benchmark data sets, we demonstrate that FastTag matches the current state-of-the-art in tagging quality , yet reduces the training and testing times by several orders of magnitude and has lower asymptotic complexity.},

abstract = {In Today's technology driven world user profiles are the virtual representation of each user and they include a variety of user information such as personal, interest and preference data. These profiles are the outcome of the user profiling process and they are essential to service personalization. Different methods , techniques and algorithms have been proposed in the literature for the user profiling process. This paper aims to give an overview on the user profiling and its related concepts, and discuss the pros and cons of current methods for the future service personalization. Furthermore, it also give details about the simulations which have been carried out with well known classification and clustering algorithms with real world user profile dataset. This work is based on the doctoral thesis of the author.},

abstract = {Making recommendations for social media presents special challenges. As tagging becomes common practice at many social media sites, this research proposes a new approach to user profiling based on the tags associated with one's personal collection of contents. To utilize the social interaction implied by tagging, a personal profile can be further extended with the tags specified by one's social contacts. A tag-to-tag matrix is defined to enable collaborative filtering-style recommendations without explicit user ratings. Experiments with collections of bookmarks and the associated tags from 42,463 users are presented and compared using the different views.},
