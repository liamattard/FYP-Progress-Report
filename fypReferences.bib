abstract = {Group recommender systems are information filtering and decision support applications that are aimed at aiding a group of users in making decisions when they are considering a set of alternatives. State of the art solutions aggregate users' preferences acquired before the actual decision making process and suggest items that fit the aggregated model. However, it has been shown that the recommendation needs of groups go beyond the identification of such items, and it is essential to take into account, in the recommendation process, the dynamic of users' interactions in their real group context. In this paper, we therefore illustrate a novel approach to group recommendation, which is implemented in a mobile system, that monitors and exploits users' interactions during a group discussion, and offers appropriate recommendations as well as other types of suggestions, to guide and help the group members in settling on an agreement. We have carried out a preliminary user study of the proposed approach to assess and analyze the usability of the system along with the perceived recommendation quality and choice satisfaction. The results of this study are encouraging as they show that the proposed approach attains a high usability score, and has good user-perceived recommendation quality as well as choice satisfaction.},

abstract = {We propose TRIPBUILDER, an unsupervised framework for planning personalized sightseeing tours in cities. We collect categorized Points of Interests (PoIs) from Wikipedia and albums of geo-referenced photos from Flickr. By considering the photos as traces revealing the behaviors of tourists during their sightseeing tours, we extract from photo albums spatio-temporal information about the itineraries made by tourists, and we match these itineraries to the Points of Interest (PoIs) of the city. The task of recommending a person-alized sightseeing tour is modeled as an instance of the Generalized Maximum Coverage (GMC) problem, where a measure of personal interest for the user given her preferences and visiting time-budget is maximized. The set of actual trajectories resulting from the GMC solution is scheduled on the tourist's agenda by exploiting a particular instance of the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP). Experimental results on three different cities show that our approach is effective, efficient and outperforms competitive baselines.},

The OP is a routing problem in which the goal is to determine a subset of nodes to visit, and in which order, so that the total collected score is maximized and a given time budget is not exceeded. A number of typical variants has been studied, such as the Team OP, the (Team) OP with Time Windows and the Time Dependent OP. Recently, a number of new variants of the OP was introduced, such as the Stochastic OP, the Generalized OP, the Arc OP, the Multi-agent OP, the Clustered OP and others. This paper focuses on a comprehensive and thorough survey of recent variants of the OP, including the proposed solution approaches. Moreover, the OP has been used as a model in many different practical applications. The most recent applications of the OP, such as the Tourist Trip Design Problem and the mobile-crowdsourcing problem are discussed. Finally, we also present some promising topics for future research.},

abstract = {Vacation planning is one of the frequent-but nonetheless laborious-tasks that people engage themselves with online; requiring skilled interaction with a multitude of resources. This paper constructs intra-city travel itineraries automatically by tapping a latent source reflecting geo-temporal breadcrumbs left by millions of tourists. For example, the popular rich media sharing site, Flickr, allows photos to be stamped by the time of when they were taken and be mapped to Points Of Interests (POIs) by geographical (i.e. latitudelongitude) and semantic (e.g., tags) metadata. Leveraging this information, we construct itineraries following a two-step approach. Given a city, we first extract photo streams of individual users. Each photo stream provides estimates on where the user was, how long he stayed at each place, and what was the transit time between places. In the second step, we aggregate all user photo streams into a POI graph. Itineraries are then automatically constructed from the graph based on the popularity of the POIs and subject to the user's time and destination constraints. We evaluate our approach by constructing itineraries for several major cities and comparing them, through a "crowdsourcing" marketplace (Amazon Mechanical Turk), against itineraries constructed from popular bus tours that are professionally generated. Our extensive survey-based user studies over about 450 workers on AMT indicate that high quality itineraries can be automatically constructed from Flickr data.},

abstract = {Sightseeing trips are often done in groups, where tourists enjoy their trip in company with their relatives or friends. Therefore, in this paper, in order to model the case of trips for tourist groups, we introduce a new problem, as an extension of the existing problem in the literature that is used for planning the trip of a single tourist. The new problem extends the existing problem with two additional concepts. The first is the consideration of multiple tourists, where their individual preferences about points of interests are taken into account, and the second is the introduction of the concept of mutual social relationship between the different tourists. For the actual single tourist trip problem, we use an algorithm that obtains comparable results with the state of the art algorithms, whereas for the group trip problem, since no solution has been published before, we design a new algorithm based on tabu search metaheuristic that uses two new unique operators for exploring the search space. As a result, this paper proposes an anytime algorithm that in average takes about 20Â s to obtain better personalized itineraries for tourist groups than when scheduling the whole group together.},

abstract = {Tourists visiting unknown destinations become increasingly dependent on mobile city guides to locate tourist services and retrieve informative content about nearby points of interest (POIs). Several mobile guides already support the provision of personalized tour recommendations to assist tourists in making feasible plans and visiting the most interesting POIs within their available time. However, existing tourist tour planners only regard available attractions as sites lacking physical dimensions (i.e., POIs are treated as 'points'). This restricts the modeling of POIs as attractions that may be entered/exited from a certain location (e.g., the main entrance). Although this is adequate for scheduling visits at museums, galleries, small squares or parks with single entry points, it fails to capture practical properties of typical tourist visiting styles in urban destinations. Tourists commonly appreciate strolling through pedestrian zones, market areas or urban areas of architectural , cultural and scenic value rather than only visiting sites of restricted access or taking the fastest route to move among city landmarks. Herein, we introduce Scenic Athens, a context aware mobile city guide for Athens (Greece) which provides personalized tour planning services to tourists. Far beyond than just providing navigational aid, Scenic Athens derives near-optimal sequencing of POIs along recommended tours, taking into account a multitude of travel restrictions and POI properties, so as to best utilize time available for sightseeing. Unlike similar tools, our application incorporates scenic (walking) routes (in addition to point POIs), thereby supporting more experiential exploration of tourist destinations. This broader perception of tourist attractions substantially increases the complexity of the entailed optimization problem's modeling. A user evaluation study validated the recommendation value, usability and perceived utility of the proposed application.},

abstract = {The touristic trip planning problem can be considered as a Multi Constrained Team Orienteering Problem with Time Windows (MCTOPTW). The MCTOPTW is characterized with a set of points of interest (POI), each having a score, a time window and some attributes such as the type or entry fee. The maximum number of POIs of certain types that can be included into the itinerary is limited. A tourist can visit the POIs during their respective time windows. The objective is to visit the points that have the highest scores during specified periods of time. This paper proposes a Tabu Search approach for solving the MCTOPTW problem. To explore the neighborhood the moves Insert, Replace and Swap are applied. Additionally, the algorithm employs a tabu list, a perturbation and a diversification mechanism. The algorithm is evaluated on benchmark instances from the literature and its performance is compared to the state of the art results. {\textcopyright} 2012 IEEE.},

abstract = {We present a mobile tourist guide for planning and conducting sightseeing day trips. Users are provided different means to access and select the available sights, events and other points of interest (POIs): Via a hybrid recommender system, via browsing by sight category, via searching over descriptions of POIs or via browsing on a map. Based on user's selection a route planner for time-constrained activities generates route suggestions taking additional constraints for public transport connections into account. A novelty of the implemented approach compared to existing solutions for tourists is that the user retains full control over the tour by diverse interaction possibilities: Before route generation different means for selecting POIs are provided, during route generation multiple route variants are suggested and after route generation users are able to directly edit any detail at any time, even if there are existing constraints that hinder the direct execution of an edit operation. Moreover, recommender, planner and editing are closely interconnected: Recommendations are used by the planner to fill-up unavoidable gaps. This may also be initiated manually during editing where also parts of the planner are involved to permit only those edits that keep the route feasible. The app is currently tailored to the city of Nuremberg but can be extended for other cities as well. {\textcopyright} 2014 Author.},

abstract = {Tour planning represents a challenging task for individuals visiting unfamiliar tourist destinations, mainly due to the availability of numerous attractions (points of interest, POIs) and the complexity of metropolitan public transit networks. Several web and mobile tourist city guides already support person-alized tour recommendations. However, they exclusively consider walking tours; namely, they fail in motivating tourists to use public transportation for reaching far located important POIs, thereby compromising the perceived overall attractiveness of recommended tours. In this paper, we introduce eCOMPASS, a context-aware web/mobile application which derives personalized multimodal tours via selected urban attractions. eCOMPASS is the only available research or commercial tour planner that assists the way arounds of tourists through public transit. Far beyond than just providing navigational aid, eCOMPASS incorporates multimodality (i.e. time dependency) within its routing logic aiming at deriving near-optimal sequencing of POIs along recommended tours so as to best utilize the time available for sightseeing and minimize waiting time at transit stops. Further advancing the state of the art, eCOMPASS allows users to define arbitrary start/end locations (e.g. the current location of a mobile user) rather than choosing among a fixed set of locations. Last, eCOMPASS may assist in scheduling lunch breaks at affordable restaurants, conveniently located along the recommended tours. The provision of the above mentioned unique features of eCOMPASS is based on modeling and solving a complex optimization problem which takes into account a long list of problem variables and constraints. This paper describes the routing algorithm which comprises the core functionality of eCOMPASS. Further, it discusses the implementation details of the web and mobile eCOMPASS applications using the metropolitan areas of Athens (Greece) and Berlin (Germany) as case studies. Evaluation results report positive user attitude as to the tour planning output with respect to attractiveness, meaningfulness and the overall perceived utility.},

@article{Souffriau2008,
abstract = {Mobile tourist guides evolve towards automated personalized tour planning devices. The contribution of this article is to put forward a combined artificial intelligence and metaheuristic approach to solve tourist trip design problems (TTDP). The approach enables fast decision support for tourists on small footprint mobile devices. The orienteering problem, which originates in the operational research literature, is used as a starting point for modelling the TTDP. The problem involves a set of possible locations having a score and the objective is to maximize the total score of the visited locations, while keeping the total time (or distance) below the available time budget. The score of a location represents the interest of a tourist in that location. Scores are calculated using the vector space model, which is a well-known technique from the field of information retrieval. The TTDP is solved using a guided local search metaheuristic. In order to compare the performance of this approach with an algorithm that appeared in the literature, both are applied to a real data set from the city of Ghent. A collection of tourist points of interest with descriptions was indexed and subsequently queried with popular interests, which resulted in a test set of TTDPs. The approach presented in this article turns out to be faster and produces solutions of better quality.},

@article{Chang2016,
abstract = {Leisure travel has become a topic of great interest to Taiwanese residents in recent years. Most residents expect to be able to relax on a vacation during the holidays; however, the complicated procedure of travel itinerary planning is often discouraging and leads them to abandon the idea of traveling. In this paper, we design an automatic travel itinerary planning system for the domestic area (ATIPS) using an algorithm to automatically plan a domestic travel itinerary based on user intentions that allows users to minimize the process of trip planning. Simply by entering the travel time, the departure point, and the destination location, the system can automatically generate a travel itinerary. According to the results of the experiments, 70{\%} of users were satisfied with the result of our system, and 82{\%} of users were satisfied with the automatic user preference learning mechanism of ATIPS. Our algorithm also provides a framework for substituting modules or weights and offers a new method for travel planning.},
