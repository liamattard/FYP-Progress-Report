abstract = {Making recommendations for social media presents special challenges. As tagging becomes common practice at many social media sites, this research proposes a new approach to user profiling based on the tags associated with one's personal collection of contents. To utilize the social interaction implied by tagging, a personal profile can be further extended with the tags specified by one's social contacts. A tag-to-tag matrix is defined to enable collaborative filtering-style recommendations without explicit user ratings. Experiments with collections of bookmarks and the associated tags from 42,463 users are presented and compared using the different views.},

@article{Ikeda,
abstract = {This paper proposes demographic estimation algorithms for profiling Twitter users, based on their tweets and community relationships. Many people post their opinions via social media services such as Twitter. This huge volume of opinions, expressed in real time, has great appeal as a novel marketing application. When automatically extracting these opinions, it is desirable to be able to discriminate discrimination based on user demographics, because the ratio of positive and negative opinions differs depending on demographics such as age, gender, and residence area, all of which are essential for market analysis. In this paper, we propose a hybrid text-based and community-based method for the demographic estimation of Twitter users, where these demographics are estimated by tracking the tweet history and clustering of followers/followees. Our experimental results from 100,000 Twitter users show that the proposed hybrid method improves the accuracy of the text-based method. The proposed method is applicable to various user demographics and is suitable even for users who only tweet infrequently.},

abstract = {In Today's technology driven world user profiles are the virtual representation of each user and they include a variety of user information such as personal, interest and preference data. These profiles are the outcome of the user profiling process and they are essential to service personalization. Different methods , techniques and algorithms have been proposed in the literature for the user profiling process. This paper aims to give an overview on the user profiling and its related concepts, and discuss the pros and cons of current methods for the future service personalization. Furthermore, it also give details about the simulations which have been carried out with well known classification and clustering algorithms with real world user profile dataset. This work is based on the doctoral thesis of the author.},
